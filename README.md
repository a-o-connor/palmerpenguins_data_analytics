## Introduction 
This git repository contains a [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/a-o-connor/palmerpenguins_data_analytics/blob/main/palmerpenguinsanalysis.ipynb) with my analysis of the Palmer Penguins data set.
The data set is available [on Git Hub](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html).
The Palmer Penguins data set contains size data gathered for three species of penguin in the Palmer Achipelago in Antarctica. It is often used as a training data set for introductory statistics and data science.
## About this project
This repository contains a jupyter notebook with my own analysis of the Palmer Penguins data set, for the purposes of the Principles of Data Analytics module I am taking as part of a course in Computer Science at ATU.
